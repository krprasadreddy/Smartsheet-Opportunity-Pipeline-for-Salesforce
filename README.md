##Smartsheet Opportunity Pipeline for Salesforce

The Smartsheet Opportunity Pipeline Import/Export for Salesforce is an application that allows the Import and Export of data between Smartsheet and Salesforce Opportunity objects.
With the app you can:*  Query and filter a list of opportunities in Salesforce and then export theopportunity data to a new sheet in Smartsheet.*  Select a sheet and import its data into Salesforce as opportunities.NOTE: This is a sample app that began as a CloudSpokes Challenge, and is meant to help developers get a jump start on developing their own Smartsheet/Salesforce integrations. As a sample, this application does not take all possibilities of error handling, mapping, importing and exporting into account. To add these functionalities for your organization, you have full access to the classes and components, and are encouraged to make changes that meet your specific needs.
You can install the [Unmanaged Package](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t50000000AUwz) into your Salesforce instance, or you can clone the source from this repository.
Instructions for installing, configuring and using the application are contained in the
